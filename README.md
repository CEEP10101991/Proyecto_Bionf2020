###### César Emiliano Escalona Prado
This repository and their contains form part of an exercises from the intensive course "Introducción a la bioinformática e investigación reproducible para análisis genómicos". In this repository you will find a group of scripts based on the  ["Practica_Stacks_smalldata"](https://github.com/u-genoma/BioinfinvRepro/blob/master/Unidad8/GBS-RAD/Practica_Stacks_smalldata.md) tutorial, that uses a reduced set of data from "Rochette, N. C. & Catchen, J. M. Deriving genotypes from RAD-seq short-read data using Stacks. Nature Protocols 12, 2640–2659 (2017)" protocol, to exemplify the De novo  assembly performed by [Stacks](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/manual/).

## Structure of repository

### [Bin](https://github.com/CEEP10101991/Proyecto_Bionf2020/tree/master/Bin)
Contains: 
* Three bash scripts numerated acording to thier excecution order 
* An .rmd file that generates a graphic report from the Stacks output obtained form this excersise and the .html output report(for the comodity of the readers, the report its also saved as a .pdf file in this folder).

### Data
Data is subdivided into two folders, structured to contain the necessary informatiosn to perform this exercise:
#### [raw](https://github.com/CEEP10101991/Proyecto_Bionf2020/tree/master/raw)
That should contains the raw .fq.gz files, (in orther to save space the inclussión of this files was omited at this repository, but inside this folder you may find a [description of the files](https://github.com/CEEP10101991/Proyecto_Bionf2020/tree/master/raw/DATA.md) used ) 
#### [info](https://github.com/CEEP10101991/Proyecto_Bionf2020/tree/master/info)
Fulfills the functions of a Meta folder,contains the barcodes and population maps, of the previously selected samples.
