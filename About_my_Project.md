##### About my Proyect

One of the main objectives of my masters project, is to analyze in detail the genetic diversity of Bursera linanoe. For this purpose I have carried out the extraction of DNA from the tissue of leaf, the proper quality extractions will be sequenced using the GBS technique on the Illumina platform HiSeq 2500.
Once obtained, the sequences will be assembled de novo, to subsequently carry out the call and annotation of SNPs, with which it will be possible to carry out analyzes regarding the variation present in thepopulations of the species.
