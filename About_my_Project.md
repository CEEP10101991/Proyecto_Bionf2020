##### About my Proyect

One of the main objectives of my masters project, is to analyze in detail the genetic diversity of Bursera linanoe. For this purpose I have carried out the extraction of DNA from the tissue of leaf, the proper quality extractions will be sequenced using the GBS technique on the Illumina platform HiSeq 2500.
Once obtained, the sequences will be assembled de novo, to subsequently carry out the call and annotation of SNPs, with which it will be possible to carry out analyzes regarding the variation present in the populations of the species.

The exercise conducted in this repository it's a good introduction / example for the de novo assembly in Stacks, and sets a protocol for test and elect the proper variables for the assembly.

As the conclusion for this particular exercise the n = 3 gives the greatest number of variant sites, keeping the greatest number of loci, however generate more test applying different values at the variables would generate better output values.

The ability to perform a varour number of combinations in a reduced amount of time (due to the testing on small data),makes this kind of protocols powerful tools to the de novo assembly Stacks users.
